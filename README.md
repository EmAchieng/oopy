Dive Inside Object-Oriented Python
======================

This repository contains code used during an Object-Oriented Python workshop at Pycon Africa 2020.

You need [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) to run the notebooks. To install it see the instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install).

For Linux and Mac systems you just have to create a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) and install the requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After this you should be able to run `jupyther notebook` and the Jupyter interface will open in your browser.

If you are not following the workshop you can find a series of posts that discuss the same topics at the [instructor's blog](https://www.thedigitalcatonline.com/blog/2014/08/20/python-3-oop-part-1-objects-and-types/)

The workshop is divided into the following sections

1. Intro and discussion about OOP
2. Objects
3. Classes
4. Instances
5. Delegation
6. Polymorphism
